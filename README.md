This is a simple website that allows users to register and login, and then play a clicking game <br>
Once the game is over, the amount of clicks in the 5 second period will be tallied, as well as the amount of clicks per second <br>
These, in addition to the current date and the user's name, will be inserted into the database, and the score will be visible on the scores page.
